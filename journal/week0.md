# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# Required Homework/Tasks

I created all the required accounts - New AWS, Gitpod, Lucid, Rollbar, Honeycomb, configured Github Codespaces, just in case.
I had a dormant domain name and host which I plugged into this bootcamp project.
I already had Cantrill course which guided me to install the AWS CLI v2 early this year after reinstalling Windows 11, but I haven't been able to continue since the year began.

I read further on how to set up Momento since this was the only requirement that was a bit edgy for me at first. I downloaded a MSI package and had it installed
Here is a screenshot of how it looks like on my PC.

I also created admin user and generated AWS access keys and Secret access keys for use on the CLI. I created cloud billing alarms and set up a $5 budget with alarm at 80% expenditure on root at first then on admin account thereafter. I tested out event setting on Amazon EventBridge and set up parameters on health issues
